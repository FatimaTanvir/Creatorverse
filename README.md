## Notes

**Challenges Encountered:**
- **Supabase Setup**: Initially struggled with Row Level Security (RLS) configuration - had to disable RLS for the creators table to allow public read/write access
- **Database Schema**: Had to ensure the table structure exactly matched the expected column names and types
- **Error Handling**: Implemented comprehensive error logging to debug database connection issues
- **Responsive Design**: Ensured the card layout works well across all device sizes

**Technical Implementation:**
- Used React 18 with Vite for fast development
- Implemented React Router for client-side navigation
- Integrated Supabase for backend database functionality
- Created custom CSS with modern design patterns
- Used async/await throughout for clean asynchronous code
- Environment variables for secure credential management

**Environment Setup:**
- Create a `.env` file in the root directory
- Add your Supabase credentials:
  ```
  VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-project-url-here
  VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-api-key-here
  ```
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and replace placeholder values

**Key Features:**
- Full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Beautiful card-based UI with hover animations
- Responsive design that works on all devices
- Real-time database updates
- Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
