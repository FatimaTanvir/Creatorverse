## Notes

**Challenges Encountered:**
- **Supabase Setup**: Initially struggled with Row Level Security (RLS) configuration - had to disable RLS for the creators table to allow public read/write access
- **Database Schema**: Had to ensure the table structure exactly matched the expected column names and types
- **Error Handling**: Implemented comprehensive error logging to debug database connection issues
- **Responsive Design**: Ensured the card layout works well across all device sizes
- **Footer Visibility**: Had to adjust component placement and CSS to ensure footer displays correctly
- **Animation Layering**: Carefully managed z-index values to ensure animations appear behind content appropriately

**Technical Implementation:**
- Used React 18 with Vite for fast development
- Implemented React Router for client-side navigation
- Integrated Supabase for backend database functionality
- Created custom CSS with modern design patterns and animations
- Used async/await throughout for clean asynchronous code
- Environment variables for secure credential management
- CSS keyframe animations for shooting stars and twinkling effects
- Glass morphism effects with backdrop-filter and transparency

**Environment Setup:**
- Create a `.env` file in the root directory
- Add your Supabase credentials:
  ```
  VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-project-url-here
  VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-api-key-here
  ```
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and replace placeholder values

- Twinkling stars around creator names on detail pages
- Responsive design that works on all devices
